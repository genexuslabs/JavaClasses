/**
 * This is the interface that a module must implement. There are two parts
 * during a request: the construction of the request, and the handling of
 * the response. A request may cycle through these parts multiple times
 * when a module generates additional subrequests (such as a redirection
 * status handling module might do).
 *
 * <P>In the first step the request handler is invoked; here the headers,
 * the request-uri, etc. can be modified, or a complete response can be
 * generated. Then, if no response was generated, the request is sent over
 * the wire. In the second step the response handlers are invoked. These
 * may modify the response or, in phase 2, may generate a new request; the
 * returned status from the phase 2 handler specifies how the processing of
 * the request or response should further proceed.
 *
 * <P>The response handling is split into three phases. In the first phase
 * the response handling cannot be modified; this is so that all modules
 * get a chance to see the returned response. Modules will typically make
 * notes of responses and do certain header processing here (for example the
 * cookie module does it's work in this phase). In the second phase modules
 * may generate new subrequests or otherwise control the further handling of
 * the response. This is typically used for response status handling (such
 * as for redirections and authentication). Finally, if no new subrequest
 * was generated, the phase 3 response handlers are invoked so that modules
 * can perform any necessary cleanups and final processing (no additional
 * subrequests can be made anymore). It is recommended that any response
 * processing which needn't be done if the request is not returned to the
 * user is deferred until this phase. For example, the Content-MD5,
 * Content-Encoding and Transfer-Encoding modules do their work in this
 * phase as the response body is usually discarded if a new subrequest is
 * generated.
 *
 * <P>When the user invokes any request method (such as <code>Get(...)</code>)
 * a list of of modules to be used is built. Then, for each module in the
 * list, an instance is created using the <code>Class.newInstance()</code>
 * method. This means that each module must have a constructor which takes
 * no arguments. This instance is then used to handle the request, its
 * response, and any additional subrequests and their responses. In this way
 * a module can easily keep state between related subrequests. For example, a
 * redirection module might want to keep track of the number of redirections
 * made to detect redirect loops; it could do this by defining an instance
 * variable and incrementing it each time the request handler is invoked.
