/**
 * This class provides an output stream for requests. The stream must first
 * be associated with a request before it may be used; this is done by
 * passing it to one of the request methods in HTTPConnection. Example:
 * <PRE>
 *    OutputStream out = new HttpOutputStream(12345);
 *    rsp = con.Post("/cgi-bin/my_cgi", out);
 *    out.write(...);
 *    out.close();
 *    if (rsp.getStatusCode() >= 300)
 *        ...
 * </PRE>
 *
 * <P>There are two constructors for this class, one taking a length parameter,
 * and one without any parameters. If the stream is created with a length
 * then the request will be sent with the corresponding Content-length header
 * and anything written to the stream will be written on the socket immediately.
 * This is the preferred way. If the stream is created without a length then
 * one of two things will happen: if, at the time of the request, the server
 * is known to understand HTTP/1.1 then each write() will send the data
 * immediately using the chunked encoding. If, however, either the server
 * version is unknown (because this is first request to that server) or the
 * server only understands HTTP/1.0 then all data will be written to a buffer
 * first, and only when the stream is closed will the request be sent.
 *
 * <P>Another reason that using the <var>HttpOutputStream(length)</var>
 * constructor is recommended over the <var>HttpOutputStream()</var> one is
 * that some HTTP/1.1 servers do not allow the chunked transfer encoding to
 * be used when POSTing to a cgi script. This is because the way the cgi API
 * is defined the cgi script expects a Content-length environment variable.
 * If the data is sent using the chunked transfer encoding however, then the
 * server would have to buffer all the data before invoking the cgi so that
 * this variable could be set correctly. Not all servers are willing to do
 * this.
 *
 * <P>If you cannot use the <var>HttpOutputStream(length)</var> constructor and
 * are having problems sending requests (usually a 411 response) then you can
 * try setting the system property <var>HTTPClient.dontChunkRequests</var> to
 * <var>true</var> (this needs to be done either on the command line or
 * somewhere in the code before the HTTPConnection is first accessed). This
 * will prevent the client from using the chunked encoding in this case and
 * will cause the HttpOutputStream to buffer all the data instead, sending it
 * only when close() is invoked.
 *
 * <P>The behaviour of a request sent with an output stream may differ from
 * that of a request sent with a data parameter. The reason for this is that
 * the various modules cannot resend a request which used an output stream.
 * Therefore such things as authorization and retrying of requests won't be
 * done by the HTTPClient for such requests. But see {@link
 * HTTPResponse#retryRequest() HTTPResponse.retryRequest} for a partial
 * solution.
