/**
 * <P>This class checks whether a sequence of requests is idempotent. This
 * is used to determine which requests may be automatically retried. This
 * class also serves as a central place to record which methods have side
 * effects and which methods are idempotent.
 *
 * <P>Note: unknown methods (i.e. a method which is not HEAD, GET, POST, PUT,
 * DELETE, OPTIONS, TRACE, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, or
 * UNLOCK) are treated conservatively, meaning they are assumed to have side
 * effects and are not idempotent.

 * <PRE>
 *     IdempotentSequence seq = new IdempotentSequence();
 *     seq.add(r1);
 *     ...
 *     if (seq.isIdempotent(r1)) ...

     * <P>We split up the sequence of requests into individual sub-sequences,
     * or threads, with all requests in a thread having the same request-URI
     * and no two threads having the same request-URI. Each thread is then
     * marked as idempotent or not according to the following rules:
     *
     * <OL>
     * <LI>If any method is UNKNOWN then the thread is not idempotent;
     * <LI>else, if no method has side effects then the thread is idempotent;

     * <LI>else, if the first method has side effects, is not complete,
     *     and no other method has side effects then the thread is idempotent;
     * <LI>else the thread is not idempotent.
     * </OL>
     *
     * <P>The major assumption here is that the side effects of any method
     * only apply to resource specified. E.g. a <tt>"PUT /barbara.html"</tt>
     * will only affect the resource "/barbara.html" and nothing else.
     * This assumption is violated by POST of course; however, POSTs are
     * not pipelined and will therefore never show up here.
