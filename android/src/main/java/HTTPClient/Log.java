/**
 * This is a simple logger for the HTTPClient. It defines a number of
 * "facilities", each representing one or more logically connected classes.
 * Logging can be enabled or disabled on a per facility basis. Furthermore, the
 * logging output can be redirected to any desired place, such as a file or a
 * buffer; by default all logging goes to <var>System.err</var>.
 *
 * <P>All log entries are preceded by the name of the currently executing
 * thread, enclosed in {}'s, and the current time in hours, minutes, seconds,
 * and milliseconds, enclosed in []'s. Example:
 * <tt>{Thread-5} [20:14:03.244] Conn:  Sending Request</tt>
 *
 * <P>When the class is loaded, two java system properties are read:
 * <var>HTTPClient.log.file</var> and <var>HTTPClient.log.mask</var>. The first
 * one, if set, causes all logging to be redirected to the file with the given
 * name. The second one, if set, is used for setting which facilities are
 * enabled; the value must be the bitwise OR ('|') of the values of the desired
 * enabled facilities. E.g. a value of 3 would enable logging for the
 * HTTPConnection and HTTPResponse, a value of 16 would enable cookie related
 * logging, and a value of 8 would enable authorization related logging; a
 * value of -1 would enable logging for all facilities. By default logging is
 * disabled.
